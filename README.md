# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

> This project identifies the digit present in an image of any handwritten digit using a one-layer Neural Network

It is a very-basic digit recognizer. It uses the MNIST database to train and test the model. Made as a part of solution to an assignment in Machine Learning course at Coursera by Prof. Andrew Ng.
